## Acknowledgements
          I would like to express my sincere gratitude to MYOSA Sensors Council for providing the essential mini-kit and technical resources that enabled me to
successfully complete the MYOSA EBAFS project. Their support and guidance throughout the event have been invaluable in turning the concept into a working prototype.
I am deeply thankful to Arun sir for his continuous encouragement, expert advice, and hands-on support, which greatly helped in troubleshooting and refining the
system’s design.I am also immensely grateful to Panimalar Engineering College for fostering an environment of innovation and providing access to the labs, equipment, 
and mentorship necessary for this project. This project would not have been possible without the combined support of these mentors and institutions,
whose contributions ensured that MYOSA EBAFS could evolve from an idea into a practical, interactive, and impactful health intervention system.

## Overview
         ●The MYOSA EBAFS (Ergonomic and Barometric Active Fitness System) is an innovative, multiagent, and multi-sensor platform designed to improve the health,
safety, and productivity of laptop users. Traditional monitoring systems often only observe posture or activity passively, but MYOSA EBAFS takes a proactive approach, 
actively intervening to correct poor posture, encourage physical activity, and reduce eye strain. Its Active Compliance Enforcement subsystem continuously monitors
user posture and, upon detecting slouching, triggers a servo motor to close the laptop screen, pausing work until the user corrects their position. 
         ●The BarometricFitness Integration gamifies exercise by tracking dumbbell lifts with a pressure sensor and converting each successful lift into jump actions in a 
runner game, providing a fun and interactive way to stay active. 
         ●Meanwhile, the Environmental Warning System uses a light sensor to monitor ambient lighting and
alerts the user when conditions are insufficient, helping prevent Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) and long-term eye strain. By combining posture correction,
fitness gamification, and environmental safety, MYOSA EBAFS transforms passive monitoring into an active, real-time health intervention system, 
ensuring users maintain correct posture, stay physically engaged, and work in optimal conditions. This holistic approach makes daily laptop use safer, 
healthier, and more productive, bridging the gap between ergonomics, fitness, and smart automation.
### Demo / Examples
        In a practical demonstration, MYOSA EBAFS actively enforces posture by detecting slouching and instantly closing the laptop screen with a servo prop, 
pausing work until the user corrects their position. Simultaneously, the BarometricFitness Integration tracks dumbbell lifts via a pressure sensor, 
converting each successful bicep curl into a jump action within a runner game, gamifying exercise and encouraging physical activity.
Additionally, the Environmental Warning System continuously monitors ambient light levels and provides alerts in low-light conditions to prevent
Computer Vision Syndrome and eye strain. Together, these features illustrate how MYOSA EBAFS combines real-time posture correction, fitness gamification, 
and environmental safety into a single interactive health intervention system that can be tested and experienced in everyday laptop use.

## Usage Instructions
●Posture Monitoring:
Place the posture sensor near your laptop.
The sensor constantly checks if you are sitting upright.
If you slouch, the system triggers the servo motor, which closes the laptop screen.
You cannot continue working until you correct your posture.
 ●Purpose: Encourages proper ergonomics and prevents back/neck strain.
Gamified Exercise Tracking:
Attach the pressure sensor to a dumbbell.
When you perform bicep curls, the sensor measures the lift.
Each correct lift converts into a jump action in a runner game. 
Purpose: Makes exercising fun, keeps users active, and integrates fitness into daily routines.
●Environmental Safety:
Place the light sensor to monitor the room’s brightness.
If lighting is too low, the system sends an alert. 
Purpose: Prevents Computer Vision Syndrome (eye strain) and promotes a healthy working environment.
●Overall Function:
The system provides real-time feedback.
It combines posture correction, exercise gamification, and environmental alerts.
Users learn to sit correctly, exercise actively, and work in safe lighting automatically.
